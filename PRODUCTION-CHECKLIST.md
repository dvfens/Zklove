- [ ] Configure `PINATA_API_KEY` and `PINATA_SECRET_KEY` for IPFS
- [ ] Set `SENTRY_DSN` for error monitoring
- [ ] Verify `RPC_URL` is working

### 2. Network Preparation
- [ ] Ensure deployer wallet has sufficient funds
  - **Mumbai Testnet**: 0.01 MATIC minimum
  - **Polygon Mainnet**: 0.1 MATIC minimum
- [ ] Test network connectivity: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com`
